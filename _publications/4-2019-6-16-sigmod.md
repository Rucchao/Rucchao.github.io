Abstract
======
  Trajectory data analytics plays an important role in many appli- cations, such as transportation optimization, urban planning, taxi scheduling, and so on. However, trajectory data analytics has a great challenge that the time cost for processing queries is too high on big datasets. In this paper, we demonstrate a distributed in-memory framework Ratel base on Spark for analyzing large scale trajecto- ries. Ratel groups trajectories into partitions by considering the data locality and load balance. We build R-Tree based global indexes to prune partitions when applying trajectory search and join. For each partition, Ratel uses a filter-refinement method to efficiently find similar trajectories. We show three kinds of scenarios - bus sta- tion planning, route recommendation, and transportation analytics. Demo attendees can interact with a web UI, pose different queries on the dataset, and nevigate the query result.
