I am an Associate Professor at Renmin University of China ([School of Information](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/Home/index.htm), [CSRanking's TOP-3 in Mainland China's DB Researches](https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2022/toyear/2024/index?mod&cn)). Currently, I am closely working with Prof. [Ju Fan](http://iir.ruc.edu.cn/~fanj/).

I did my postdoc with Prof. [Guoliang Li](http://dbgroup.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ligl/index.html) at Database group, Tsinghua University. I was awarded the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science, at University of Helsinki, Finland. I am very honored to have Prof. [Jiaheng Lu](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jilu/) as my Ph.D. supervisor. Prior to joining UH, I spent one year at School of Information, Renmin University of China (RUC) for Ph.D. studies, [Here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzk0NzE2OTU4Nw==&mid=2247505995&idx=1&sn=5017031e94a862d8dde15412b648ee5a&chksm=c2ea84dcd020a875a0794608a5854a684c6d5b22b3694621f1cbceeaf546e18f7ba75d789c5e&scene=27) is a recent interview about me.

My current research topic focuses on performance benchmarking and optimization for cutting-edge data systems including HTAP databases, AI-Enhanced DBMSs, Cloud-Native Databases, and Big Data Systems. Please find more details in my selected [publications](https://rucchao.github.io//publications/).
